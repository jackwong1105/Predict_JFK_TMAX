# Predict_JFK_TMAX
The temperature_prediction project is a guided walkthrough focused on predicting temperatures using historical weather data. It covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and building machine learning models, making it ideal for learning time-series analysis and predictive modeling techniques.

Based on the temperature_prediction project in the Dataquest project walkthroughs repository, here are some key bullet points summarizing the project:

Project Overview:
The project focuses on predicting temperatures using historical data.
It serves as a guided walkthrough for learning data analysis, preprocessing, and machine learning techniques.

Learning Objectives:
Understand how to clean and preprocess weather data.
Explore time-series data and extract meaningful features.
Build machine learning models for temperature prediction.

Technologies and Libraries:
Python is the primary programming language.
Libraries used may include: Pandas for data manipulation. NumPy for numerical computations. Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization.
Scikit-learn for machine learning.

Dataset:
The project likely uses a historical weather dataset (details on the dataset would be in the repository or notebook).
The dataset may include features such as date, temperature, humidity, and other weather-related variables.

Steps in the Project:
Load and explore the dataset.
Clean the data and handle missing values.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.
Feature engineering to improve model performance.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train machine learning models such as Linear Regression or Decision Trees.
Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).

Expected Outcomes:
A trained machine learning model capable of predicting future temperatures based on historical data.
Insights into the relationships between weather variables and temperature.

Target Audience:
Beginners and intermediate learners in data science and machine learning.
Individuals looking to learn time-series analysis and temperature prediction techniques.
